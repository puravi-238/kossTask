# kossTask


In this task I build a image viewer i.e, images can be shown one after one by clicking the navigation button (arrow right and arrow left) I also wanted to add mouse event but it arise many complication to get index value of image that is clicked from storage :').The task given to me was to build reddit gallery might be I'm wrong in understanding the question . Kindly check what I made and I will change accordingly, if it comes across with any inaccuracy.

approach : 
In html there are 4 div namely container: contains all div
viewer : contains the image which to be display
slider : used for to show next one
storage : contains all image

In css : some styles you can check it tho

In js : I first add all images to storage and viewer and show the first one then I make event keydown function which change image accordingly with the help of event.key method
