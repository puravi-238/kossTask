# kossTask

In this task I build a image viewer i.e, images can be shown one after one by clicking the navigation botton (arrowright and arrowleft).The task given to me was to build reddit gallery might be I'm wrong in understond the question . Kindly check what I made any and I will change accordingly, if it come across with any inaccuracy.
approach : 
In html thier are 4 div namely container: contains all div
viewer : contains the image which to be display
slider : used for to show next one
storage : contains all image

In css : some styles you can check it tho

In js : I first add all images to storage and viewer and show the first one then I make event keydown function which change image accorrdingly with the help of event.key method
